House Stark of winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, protector of the realm, Regent.

unfortunately, Ned did meet the wrong end of an axe and lost his head

Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to begin,
 and let me assure you he will DEFINITELY NOT DIE!

Joffrey is a little snotty brat and spent way too much time being a little snotty
king. Luckily (and not a moment too soon), he was poisoned at his wedding and
died, and everyone was very thankful. Because he was a little shit.

His younger brother Tommen became king instead, and while he was a nice person, at least,
he was a wimpy and terrible king.

Someone is likely going to kill him, too, but that hasn't happened yet.
